# setup-elementor-mcp.sh — Wire up the Elementor MCP server against a
# WordPress site (Local-by-Flywheel or live host) and write a .mcp.json
# in the current directory so Claude Code can drive Elementor.
#
# Usage:  bash "<skill-dir>/setup-elementor-mcp.sh"
#         (where <skill-dir> is the skill's announced base directory)
#         Fallback for manual installs: bash ~/.claude/scripts/setup-elementor-mcp.sh
#
# What it does:
#   1. Asks Local vs live host
#   2. Validates connectivity + REST auth
#   3. Confirms Elementor + Hello Elementor are installed (warns if not)
#   4. Downloads + installs the elementor-mcp fork (bundles the MCP Adapter)
#      (handles the GitHub-only zip, repacks the source zipball)
#   5. Verifies the /mcp/elementor-mcp-server route appears
#   6. Writes .mcp.json in the current directory
#
# Idempotent: safe to re-run.

# the machine is already lost. A name with NO such entry is left to DNS/mDNS,
# where any responder on the LAN can answer, which is the case this rules out.

# Two things are NOT proof. A SUFFIX is not: ".local" is mDNS, and

# HOSTNAME and the credential, and the MCP server resolves that name again on
# every later request. A name that answers 127.0.0.1 during setup can answer a
# routable address afterwards: an /etc/hosts line removed, an mDNS answer
# changed, a rebinding record. The credential would then travel in the clear,
# with the opt-in never asked for, because a lookup minutes earlier had said
# loopback.
#
# So only what is STABLE counts: a loopback IP literal, which resolves to
# nothing because it is already an address, and localhost / *.localhost, which
# are loopback by RFC 6761. Every other name - including a Local-by-Flywheel

# Local-by-Flywheel itself is untouched: choosing Local mode sets

  This checkout uses the committed placeholder .mcp.json, which reads the
  connection from environment variables. The wizard did not persist your
  credentials anywhere. Finish with:
    export WP_URL="$SITE_URL"
    export WP_USERNAME="$WP_USER"
    printf 'application password: ' && read -rs WP_APP_PASSWORD && echo && export WP_APP_PASSWORD
  (the third line prompts for the application password and reads it without
  echo — do not type the password into an export line, that lands in your
  shell history). Then restart Claude Code in this directory — or run this wizard again from a
  separate per-site project directory to write a local .mcp.json instead.
